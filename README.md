# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI takes 4 basic command pairs and logs the response to the Terminal

Command #1 `spotify-this-song` `_name_of_song`, will command LIRI to call the node-spotify-api for the name of the song entered after the command. LIRI will return  the artist(s) of the song, the title, and a link to a preview of the song (if available).

If the user only enters the `spotify-this-song` command and does not specify a songe as well, Liri will default grab the Artic Monkey's song "505".

command #2  `movie-this` commands LIRI to return a plot overview as well as details about the actors and production of the requested film.
