# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI takes 4 basic command pairs and logs the response to the Terminal

Command #1 `spotify-this-song` `_name_of_song`, this will command LIRI to call the node-spotify-api and then grab  the artist(s), song name, and link to a preview of the song (if available).
